# Algorithm-visualizer
This project is made to visualize the working of the _**sorting**_ and _**pathfinding algorithm**_.
Following sorting algorithm has been implemented:
- [x] **Bubble Sort**
- [x] **Insertion Sort**
- [x] **Selection Sort**
- [x] **Quick Sort**
- [x] **Merge Sort**
- [ ] **Heap Sort**

Pathfinding algorithm will soon be implememted.
