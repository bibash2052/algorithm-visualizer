# Algorithm-visualizer
This project is made to visualize the working of the _**sorting**_ and _**pathfinding algorithm**_.
Following sorting algorithm has been implemented:
	**- Bubble Sort
	- Insertion Sort
	- Selection Sort
	- Quick Sort
	- Merge Sort**
Remaining sorting algorithm is Heap Sort.
Pathfinding algorithm will soon be implememted.
