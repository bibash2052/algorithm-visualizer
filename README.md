# algorithm-visualizer
This project is made to visualize the working of the sorting and pathfinding algorithm.
Following sorting algorithm has been implemented:
	1. Bubble Sort
	2. Insertion Sort
	3. Selection Sort
	4. Quick Sort
	5. Merge Sort
Remaining sorting algorithm is Heap Sort.
Pathfinding algorithm will soon be implememted.
